In your terminal (I'm using git bash in VSCode) cd into the folder you want to clone your new repo into.
**Cloning and making a branch**
1. something like `cd ~/Documents`
2. Then go online to the repo you want to clone, find the green "code tab" and copy the url in there, this one is https://github.com/JacobChild/git_testing.git
3. Go back to the terminal and we want to clone (or locally copy) this repo so `git clone https://github.com/JacobChild/git_testing.git`
4. That makes a new folder. Now, we need to go into that folder, so cd into that repo name, in our case `cd git_testing`
5. Now to create a new branch, we will call it "TestBranch1", we say `git branch TestBranch1`
6. To check it worked you can say `git branch ` and it will list all of the branches, with an asterisk by the one you are on, we are still on main in this case
7. Now to switch and work on the branch you want, say `git checkout TestBranch1` and we are officially on that branch. 
8. At this point you probably want to start editing things, so open this folder in whatever ide you use- note that what you open will have the contents of the branch.
9. Make whatever changes you want and then you want to upload them online, this is called a commit. To stage changes to be uploaded `git add --all` this stages all files
10. then to commit with a message `git commit -m "first commit to the branch!"

**Updating a branch with main**
This very file doesn't currently exist in my branch because I made it after. I am going to add it, note that the branch will only have up to here as the rest of the steps were done after I committed this file.
1. We need to update the local version of the main branch, so switch to the main branch `git checkout main`
2. Update this branch `git pull`
3. go back to the branch you want to update `git checkout TestBranch1`
4. merge the main branch into TestBranch1 `git merge main`
