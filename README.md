# ReadMe for git_testing
I frequently forget some git flow as I am working and have to do lots of googling, or I am concerned that I will mess up someone's master, or my own, or make changes I didn't want to etc. I know in theory you can't lose code (yay github and versioning), but it still scares me and I wanted to make a safe space for me to test it all out.
Thanks for visiting, and I'll record important stuff below. 
*Note: I am going to try and do everything from the terminal as the vs code add-on, while useful for basic commits etc, I think can be limiting, as well as github desktop can also be limiting. The terminal is more powerful in my opinion and something I should be more familiear with anyway.
